so i need useeffect, but why as i can use client component inside server component

Ah, now I get your exact question, mate — this is a subtle but important point. Let’s break it down clearly.

1️⃣ Server Component → Client Component

You can render a Client Component inside a Server Component, yes.

The Server Component can fetch data and pass it as a prop (even as a promise) to the Client Component.

Example:

// Server Component
export default async function Page() {
  const posts = getPosts(); // returns a promise
  return <Posts posts={posts} />; // Posts is a Client Component
}


Here, the Client Component doesn’t fetch anything itself, it just reads the promise using use (or handles interactivity).

✅ This works perfectly if the Server already has the data.

2️⃣ Why useEffect is still needed

useEffect is needed only in these situations:

Client-only data fetching

When data is not available on the server (e.g., browser API, user-specific data, local storage).

Example: fetching user-specific info after login.

Dynamic or interactive requests

Like filters, searches, infinite scroll, button clicks.

Server Components can’t handle client-triggered events, only pre-rendered data.

External APIs from the browser

If you need to fetch something directly from the client (for example, a public API that requires client headers or tokens), Server Components can’t do this.

3️⃣ TL;DR

Server → Client Component: Great for static or pre-fetched data; no useEffect needed.

useEffect: Needed when data depends on client-side context or user interaction.

💡 Simple rule:

If your data comes from the server and can be passed as props → use use hook or just pass the promise.
If your data depends on the client or changes due to user actions → use useEffect.
