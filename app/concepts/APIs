4. What did we achieve?
With useEffect:

Browser fetches data

UI shows after fetch

SEO not good

Slower

Needs client JS

With Suspense:

Server fetches data (fast)

Suspense streams to client

SEO perfect

Faster

Less client JS

No need for useEffect

🟡 5. When Suspense CANNOT replace useEffect

You still need useEffect for:

✔ Button clicks → fetch
✔ User searches
✔ Filters
✔ Infinite scroll
✔ Client-only APIs
✔ localStorage, cookies
✔ Live update (polling)

Suspense cannot handle these.

⭐ Final Answer

➡️ Suspense can replace useEffect only when the data comes from the server.
➡️ If the fetch depends on user interaction or runs in the browser → useEffect is required.

When to use which
Scenario	Recommended approach
Server already fetches data, you just want to render it in Client Component	use hook + <Suspense>
You want to fetch data entirely on the client (after page load, on user action)	useEffect + useState
Need complex client-side caching, revalidation, or infinite scroll	SWR or React Query
