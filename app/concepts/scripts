whats script component in next.js
The <Script> component in Next.js is a special way to load external JavaScript (like Google Analytics, ads, chat widgets, etc.) in an optimized and performance-friendly way.

Mate, here’s the simplest explanation you’ll find 👇

✅ What is <Script> in Next.js?

It is a built-in Next.js component that allows you to load third-party scripts without blocking page rendering, with different loading strategies.

Import it like:

import Script from "next/script";

🧠 Why do we use <Script>?

Because adding scripts manually (like using <script> in HTML) can slow your page or cause hydration issues.

Next.js <Script> gives:

Faster page loading

No layout shift

Automatic optimizations

Controlled loading order

📌 Example 1: Load a script AFTER page loads
<Script src="https://example.com/some-script.js" strategy="lazyOnload" />


strategy="lazyOnload"
= load after the entire page loads (best for analytics).

📌 Example 2: Load a script AFTER hydration
<Script src="https://example.com/widget.js" strategy="afterInteractive" />


This is the most common.

📌 Example 3: Load script BEFORE page renders
<Script src="https://example.com/critical.js" strategy="beforeInteractive" />


Use only for scripts your page NEEDS immediately (rare).

🧨 Why not use normal <script>?

Because:

They block rendering

They can break hydration

They load slower

They aren't optimized

No control on when they execute

Next.js <Script> fixes all this.
